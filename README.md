.puz format is used widely by "commercial software for crossword puzzles",
and there's an informal description of the spec [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/puz/wikis/FileFormat.wiki) but it's fairly complex for our use case. Includes a bunch of
info about solving state, rebus clues (where multiple letters can fit in a square), checksums, etc.

For us, a crossword file will be a text file containing letters arranged in a grid. 
. represents an open square, # represents a black square.

## Formulation
Our goal is to take a grid as input and search for a grid such that:
* all of the original letters and black tiles are in the same place as they were in the input
* there are no blank squares
* every clue represents a valid word

## Brute force

Based on our word list with 2310 words, there are roughly 2310^5 = 6,577,485,501,510,000 possibilities
for the across clues (in reality, this is slightly smaller because we can't repeat words, but it's not meaningfully different). One strategy might be to run through all of these combinations and check
whether they produce valid down clues as well, but this is... unlikely to be fruitful. For a sense of
scale, let's say we were able to check 1 million of these possibilities per second (which is already very
optimistic). In that case, it would still take us 208 years to run through all of the combinations.

This option is kind of like a random guess-and-check strategy: the checks we're doing aren't letting us
narrow down the number of options we have to choose from.

## Search
Instead of searching via brute force, it can be helpful to think of the grids we're searching as nodes
in a graph. From any partially-filled grid, we can move to another grid by taking an unfilled clue and
filling it with a valid word. Our strategy is to search this graph to find a grid that matches our constraints
above. Since we're going to be searching a graph, we need to choose between breadth-first and depth-first
search.

Breadth-first search is good at examining the entire solution space and finding the most optimal solution 
efficiently. Is this a good fit for us?
* Our search space is really wide, and our valid solutions are far away. Each grid has thousands of potential neighbours, and to get to a valid solution, we have to take as many steps as there are clues in the grid. Breadth-first search will get caught examining all the neighbors and won't ever make it to the end.
* No clear notion of what it means to be optimal. Is it better to have unique words that stretch people's vocabulary? Is it better to include interesting letters, or different combinations of letters? Does the fill not matter at all, or can we make up for a poor grid with interesting clues? We might have heuristics for what makes a crossword better or worse, but at the end of the day, crosswords are made for people to solve, and our program won't be as good as a person is at determining whether our fill is subjectively good.
* Measures are global, not local. The quality of a puzzle isn't something that can be determined on the fly. We could have a promising start with exciting entries, only for it to fall short because the only crossing clues that make it work are clunky words that no one uses in real life. 

Therefore, we'll go with depth-first search, which will look like the following:
1. Pick a clue to fill.
2. For each possible word that we can fill, search the grid that results from filling that word
3. If none of the possible words resulted in a valid grid, then there's no valid grid from this starting point, so we can return. There's no need to check the rest of the clues for this grid.

To make this work well, we'll need to make use of our knowledge of crosswords to direct our search and eliminate certain possibilities that we know won't be fruitful.

## Attempt 1 (naive fill): search by checking the most constrained clue first

This is essentially brute force, but with a heuristic that can help us avoid spending too much
time in the iteration phase. By checking the most constrained clue first, we're more likely
to exit early. E.g. if we look at partial grid:
```
abode
decor
.....
.....
.....
```
The third row has no restrictions, so we could put anything there and continue on. However,
we probably want to fill the clues that are harder to satisfy first, otherwise we'll waste
a lot of time. So, it might make more sense to try to fill the first column first instead
since we may exit early.

Churned away with some poor seed entries at the top (abode)
Produced the following result for chimp at the top:
```
chimp
audio
brisk
arose
lymyr
```

This would be great, except the last across answer isn't real!
This is because we aren't checking whether there are candidates for the neighbor grid before marking it as complete.
However, this illustrates the importance of a good seed. Although the "chimp" seed never
produced a well-filled grid, it was 90% of the way there, whereas the "abode" seed never produced any grids.

My algorithm also produced this grid at one point, which breaks an important rule in crosswords: no repeated words. (it has 2)
```
chimp
humor
imbue
rouse
preen
```

# Smarter fill
These two things can be fixed, but our algorithm is still slow. We can improve that
by using a better heuristic for searching (so that we can eliminate more options). 
We can improve on this by taking some ideas from this paper: 
https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/1990/AAAI90-032.pdf
Their idea is that after we've picked the most constrained clue, we should rank options
by the number of possibilities they leave open for subsequent words.

I ran this process for a few hours on my laptop and it generated 51 grids. The first was
available within a minute and I used it to build this crossword:

I actually rotated the grid from the configuration my program spit out because it resulted
in some interested stacked across clues that shared a theme. How serendipitous!
